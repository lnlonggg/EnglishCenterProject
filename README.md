E-Center: English Center Management Website

This is a university group project (Group 5 - DHTI16A4HN) to build a professional, full-featured web application for an English Center using .NET 8 and modern software architecture principles.

1. Project Description

The primary goal of this project is to create a commercial-ready platform where students can browse, select, and enroll in courses, while administrators and teachers can manage the academic operations.

The system is being built from the ground up, focusing on a clean, maintainable, and scalable architecture (applying SOLID principles) to serve as a high-quality portfolio piece.

2. Core Features (Planned)

The application will support three main user roles:

For Students (Public Users):

Create an account and manage their profile.

Browse a catalog of available courses (e.g., "IELTS 6.5", "TOEIC 750+").

View detailed class schedules for each course, including:

Class times (e.g., "Mon-Wed, 18:00-20:00").

Start and end dates.

Format (Online or Offline).

The assigned Teacher's profile (name, bio, photo).

Enroll in a specific class that fits their schedule.

View their enrollment history.

For Admins (Admin Dashboard):

Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for Courses.

Full CRUD operations for Classes (e.g., open a new class, set its schedule, assign a teacher).

Full CRUD operations for Teacher profiles.

Manage user accounts (Students and Teachers).

View all enrollments by class or by student.

For Teachers (Teacher Dashboard):

Log in to a simple, dedicated dashboard.

View their assigned teaching schedule (a list of classes they are assigned to teach).
